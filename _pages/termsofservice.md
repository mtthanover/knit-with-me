# Knit With Me Terms of Use and Service Agreement
Welcome to Knit With Me! 

This Knit With Me Terms of Service and Use Agreement (the “Agreement”), is a contract between you (“you,” “your,” or “Service Provider,” to the extent you open an Account (defined below) to give feedback on Knit With Me app and Fractal Labs, Inc (together with its parents and affiliates, “Fractal Labs, Inc.,” “Hackberry Foods,” “Knit With Me,” “we,” “our” or “us”). This Agreement governs your access to and use of the Knit With Me app (the “App”) and all other interactions with Fractal Labs, Inc.

The Knit With Me mobile application (the “App”), and all information, content, products, software and other materials made available to you on or through the App (collectively, the “Knit With Me Services”).

THIS AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMITS THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE. PLEASE READ SECTION 12 BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION.

In addition to the terms of this Agreement, by using the Knit With Me Services, you also agree to the terms of our Community Guidelines, which are hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement, and represent that you have read and consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy.

We may update the Agreement at any time, at our sole discretion. It’s important that you review the Agreement whenever we update it because if you continue to use the Knit With Me Services after we have posted the updated Agreement on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the updated Agreement. If you don’t agree to be bound by the updated Agreement, then you may not use the Hackberry Services anymore. Because our Knit With Me Services are evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Knit With Me Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

You may cancel your Subscription, change your plan, or change the settings on your Subscription through Apple. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL SUBSCRIPTION PLAN CHARGES (IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) INCURRED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF YOUR CANCELLATION.
In the event you cancel your Subscription, please note that we may still send you promotional communications about Knit With Me.

By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your Subscription or other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”).

You must resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your Order. In the event you want to change or update payment information associated with your Account, you can do so at any time by updating your payment and subscription preferences through Apple.

All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges, if any, will be charged in addition to the prices shown on the Sites. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice; provided, however, that if we change the amounts or other charges associated with your Subscription, we will provide advance notice of such changes. We will not, however, be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes. The shipment of merchandise or a plan, as applicable, to you after our delivery of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless you cancel your Subscription(s) in accordance with the cancellation policies set forth.

All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to make partial shipments of any Order, to discontinue offering certain Products, to substitute Products without prior notice, or cancel an order outright. We strive to provide you with high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain Products and market conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at knitwithmeapp@gmail.com.

The information regarding price, Product specifications, and availability contained on the Site has been provided by our manufacturers, vendors, and suppliers (“Suppliers”). The prices charged by Suppliers on the Site are the prices agreed upon by us at the time the Supplier joins the Site. Although we will attempt to make certain that the prices listed on the Site are accurate, and that out-of-stock items are clearly marked or removed from the inventory on the Site, prices and product availability may differ and are subject to change, including if you select a delivery or pickup date that is different from the date on which you place your order. Moreover, though every effort is made to ensure accuracy in posting pricing information, discrepancies do occur. In the event that the checkout price and the price posted on the Site are different, the checkout price will prevail in every case.

Of course, if you become aware that the Site contains inaccurate information, please contact us.

We will collect applicable sales tax on Products shipped to the states for which we determine we have a duty to collect sales tax. If an item is subject to sales tax, you agree that the amount of taxes shown at checkout may be adjusted. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates.

You agree to pay any shipping and handling charges shown at the time you make a purchase. We reserve the right to increase, decrease, add or eliminate shipping and handling charges from time to time, but we will provide notice of the charges applicable to you before you make your purchase. Generally, shipping is handled by a third-party courier. When you purchase a Product from Knit With Me and/or Fractal Labs, Inc., any shipping times shown on the Sites are estimates only. Actual delivery dates may vary. You agree that you will not obtain, or direct shipment of, a Product for export. All Products purchased from us are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that title to and the risk of loss of such Products passes to you upon our delivery of the Product to the third-party courier.

You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any damage or other issues upon delivery. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining the freshness of the Products you receive. You should always inspect your delivery to confirm that the product has arrived in a good condition. If you have any reason to believe that any Product in your delivery is not suitable for consumption, contact us at hackberryfoods@gmail.com. To maintain the quality and integrity of the Products, we recommend that you immediately refrigerate all perishable Products upon delivery and follow the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) instructions on refrigeration and food safety. From the time of delivery, the condition and consumption of the Products are solely at your risk, and you are solely responsible for the proper and safe washing, handling, preparation, storage, cooking, use and consumption of the Products following delivery. We recommend that you follow the USDA’s instructions on safe food handling. Failure to follow safe food handling practices and temperature recommendations may increase the risk of foodborne illness. In addition, pregnant women, young children, the elderly and individuals with compromised immune systems should follow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recommendations on food consumption for at-risk groups.
If you are not at home when your delivery arrives, the courier will generally leave the package for you at your door. Any individual at the delivery address who accepts a delivery from us is presumed to be authorized to receive such delivery. In cases in which you have designated an alternative receiver, such person shall accept the delivery under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had you accepted the delivery yourself.

In the case of inclement weather or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur prior to the scheduled delivery date. In the event that timely delivery is not feasible, we will cancel your delivery for the period so affected and issue you a credit or refund of the purchase price for that delivery.

You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products for commercial purposes.

If you are dissatisfied with a Product for any reason, please contact us at hackberryfoods@gmail.com. Certain items are not returnable unless required by law. Any full or partial refunds given will be by credit to the credit card used to buy the item or service. Return and refund policies vary by product or service as follows:
(a)      Knit With Me Premium - Monthly Subscription: All sales are final, but you may cancel at any time. You will be charged on the first of the month, and you must cancel before the first of the month in order to avoid being charged.

You acknowledge and agree that you and Fractal Labs, Inc. are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
